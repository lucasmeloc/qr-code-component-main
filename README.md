## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Box model
- Flexbox
- Media queries
- BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

### What I learned

I learned to use some flexbox properties to align elements as well as use media queries to make the layout responsive with both complementing each other. I also learned how to use variables in css to reuse some styles like colors and also the applicability of the modular CSS BEM architecture.

### Continued development

I intend to keep learning more and more. Here's a list of some specific things I'm looking to learn in the short term:

- Sass
- Grid layout

### Useful resources

- [Video about BEM Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltjnLyjFZk) - This helped me to more easily understand how the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) architecture works. I really liked the explanation, because it clarified some doubts that I had during the studies.
